# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. T3 Code supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with six entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]       |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]     |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]     |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]         |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode] |
| `copilot`     | [`Drivers/CopilotDriver.ts`][copilot]   |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

`ProviderService.sendTurn` expands [assistant citations](./assistant-citations.md) into quoted
reference data before dispatching to any adapter. Bound user comments remain distinct from the quoted
assistant text. Persisted messages keep their serialized links.

Adding a driver means writing the driver plus adapter and adding it to `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS`. No
orchestration, contract, or client change is required for the common case.

### GitHub Copilot discovery

Copilot is an explicit provider-instance-only driver; it has no legacy `providers.copilot` mirror,
so merely upgrading the server never creates or starts a Copilot instance. Each configured instance
launches the user's separately installed `copilot` executable over the stable first-party
`@github/copilot-sdk` stdio transport. The CLI continues to own credentials in the operating-system
keychain or supported environment variables; T3 Code does not copy or persist them.

The `CopilotSdkRuntime` service is the single test injection seam for SDK startup, cleanup,
authentication, status, models, sessions, failures, and timeouts. Production resolves bare
executable names against the provider-instance environment, Windows `PATHEXT`, and conservative GUI
install paths before opening stdio. A successful account inventory is authoritative and its first
entry is the live preferred default. Failed refreshes retain the last successful catalog, and no
static model is invented.

Each enabled provider instance owns one scoped SDK client and its own map of T3 thread ids to SDK
sessions. The Copilot adapter maps SDK assistant, reasoning, tool, usage, and idle events onto
canonical runtime events. Its thread snapshots retain the provider events grouped under the T3 turn
that observed them. Stopping an instance disconnects all of its sessions before the SDK client scope
closes. Attachments are accepted only after resolving a known T3 attachment id inside the configured
attachment store.

Every Copilot turn settles through one path, so a turn emits `turn.completed` exactly once no matter
which of interrupt, idle, runtime error, send failure, or session stop reaches it first. Native SDK
events are tagged with the turn that was live when the runtime emitted them, so events trailing a
settled turn are dropped instead of mutating the turn the user started next, and the aborted
`session.idle` the runtime still owes an interrupted turn is swallowed whenever it lands. The SDK
gives no turn correlation on its events, so a runtime that emits an item or usage event for an
interrupted turn only after accepting the next turn's message can still attribute that one event to
the newer turn; nothing in that class can settle a turn or leave a thread running. Interrupting
settles the visible turn before the SDK abort is awaited, and a refused abort escalates to a session
stop rather than leaving a runtime nobody can stop. Errors the runtime recovers from on the same
turn - an auto-switchable rate limit, a context limit it compacts and retries - surface as
`runtime.warning` and leave the turn running; every other `session.error` is one `runtime.error`
that fails the turn. A `session.shutdown` settles the visible turn, disconnects the SDK session, and
reports one `session.exited` whose exit kind reflects whether Copilot crashed. Interrupting, a
runtime shutdown, and a session stop all release the session's open approvals, and teardown also
releases a send the runtime never answered, so nothing outlives the work that opened it.

Commands and skills are workspace data, not machine data. `CopilotDriver.snapshotForCwd` reads them
through the instance's existing SDK connection - `workspaceCommands` opens a throwaway session in
that directory for Copilot's own command list, `workspaceSkills` discovers the project's skills -
and the registry files the result under that `cwd`. Neither read can fail the caller: a refused or
hanging discovery costs the user the catalog for one directory and nothing else, and the
instance-wide snapshot advertises no commands or skills at all. Malformed skill entries are dropped
individually, and a source T3 does not recognise is published without a scope rather than under a
guessed one.

The composer writes a skill pick as `$name`, which Copilot does not read. `rewriteCopilotSkillMentions`
turns every mention naming an advertised command into `/name` before routing, so a lone pick invokes
the skill through the command RPC and a mention inside prose reaches the agent as command text it can
act on itself; a mention Copilot never advertised is left verbatim. The two command reads differ on
skills deliberately: the published catalog omits them, because Copilot repeats every user-invocable
skill as a command and the client already drops those rows in favour of the skill entry (142 commands
against 32 on one real inventory), while the live session's routing set includes them so those names
stay invocable.

A turn whose prompt names a command the session advertised is invoked through `commands.invoke`;
everything else, including slash text naming a command Copilot did not advertise, goes out through
`send` unchanged. Commands T3 Code owns through its own interface - `model`, `plan`, `default` -
never reach the catalog, so they cannot be routed either. A command that answers with an agent
prompt becomes that turn's message and settles through the normal event path; one that answers
directly is rendered as a single assistant message and settles the turn on the spot, because it
produces no session events of its own. A refused invocation fails the turn exactly once, through the
same settlement path as a refused send.

### Grok health check

`checkGrokProviderStatus` never opens an ACP session. It runs `grok --version`, then `grok models`
for login state and model slugs, then a single ACP `initialize` and reads models from
`_meta.modelState`. `authenticate` and `session/new` are skipped on purpose: `authenticate` can open
a browser login and `session/new` boots every configured MCP server, both of which made background
probes hang or surprise the user. A failed `initialize` degrades to `warning` with the CLI's model
list instead of persisting `error` over a working install. The built-in `grok-build` slug is the
CLI's product name, not an ACP model id. `applyGrokAcpModelSelection` treats it as "keep the
session's current model" and never sends it in `session/set_model`.

## OpenCode server ownership and catalog

Each OpenCode provider instance owns one lazy local server for catalog discovery and
text-generation helpers through [`OpenCodeServerOwner.ts`][opencode-server-owner]. Concurrent
borrowers share startup. The server closes 30 seconds after the last borrower releases it, or
when the provider instance closes. A failed or exited process can be started again on the next
use. An externally configured OpenCode server remains externally owned.

The local server and its SDK clients use one resolved password. An explicit provider password
overrides `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` in the spawned environment. Without an explicit password,
the client uses the password from the environment that the process inherits. External servers use
only their explicit provider password and never inherit the host's local password.

Every server connection must pass the authenticated `/global/health` check before inventory or
session operations start. The response must contain a valid version at or above 1.14.19. Local
owners cache this result for the lifetime of the spawned process. External actions check once when
they create their server connection, not for each model or SDK request.

Chat adapters keep their own server per thread. They register a thread-specific `t3-code` MCP
connection, while OpenCode stores MCP connections by directory. Sharing these chat servers
without changing MCP routing would let two threads in one directory replace each other's
connection.

OpenCode loads its catalog through the HTTP API when an enabled provider instance starts. The
provider registry keeps the snapshot in memory and persists it in the existing per-instance cache.
Each `subscribeServerConfig` connection refreshes all providers, so a client reconnect reloads the
OpenCode catalog from the current helper. The `serverRefreshProviders` request also refreshes it.
Periodic OpenCode probes remain disabled. OpenCode reads credentials for each inventory request,
but its native configuration files can remain cached for the lifetime of the helper process. The
helper closes 30 seconds after its last inventory or text-generation borrower releases it. A
refresh after that idle period starts a new helper and reads file changes. Repeated refreshes and
active text-generation work can extend process reuse. Changes to the provider configuration or
environment replace the instance and start a new discovery. Changes to unrelated settings only
update snapshot enrichment. Other providers retain their existing refresh policy.

T3 Code does not own an external OpenCode process. Native configuration changes there can require
an external reload or restart before T3 Code's next refresh sees them.

The shared server's idle shutdown does not clear the catalog. Failed discovery keeps the last
known models, slash commands, and skills through the registry's existing merge rules. A successful
empty inventory is authoritative. Existing threads keep their explicit model identifier and
options when catalog metadata is missing; the catalog is not permission to choose a different
model for a thread.

## Model manifest

The model picker's legacy section is driven by `apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json`, which
lists the current (non-legacy) model slugs per driver kind. The `ModelManifest` service
(`apps/server/src/provider/ModelManifest.ts`) refreshes that data from the same file on `main` via
raw.githubusercontent.com, so moving a model in or out of the legacy section is a commit, not a
release. Preference order is remote fetch, then the on-disk copy of the last successful fetch (in
the state directory), then the bundled copy. Fetches are TTL-gated, run concurrently with provider
probes, respect the `enableProviderUpdateChecks` setting, and never fail a provider check. The
Codex and Claude drivers apply the classification to every snapshot with `applyModelManifest`;
driver kinds absent from the manifest have no legacy concept.

## Attachment access

The server stores uploaded attachments in its attachment directory, outside the project workspace.
`ProviderService` adds the absolute path of each attachment to the turn text, then passes every
attachment to the provider adapter. Each adapter decides what its provider ingests natively:

- Codex, Claude, Cursor, and Grok send images as native image inputs and skip generic files. For
  these providers, generic files reach the agent only as file paths in the turn text.
- OpenCode sends PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP images, text files, and PDFs up to 20 MB as native file parts
  with their real mime type. Everything else (ZIP and other binaries, image formats model APIs
  reject, oversized files) falls back to the file path in the turn text, like the other providers.

Claude receives the attachment directory as an allowed additional directory. Codex keeps its
configured sandbox policy, so access depends on that policy and the selected runtime mode. OpenCode
allows all paths in full-access mode and requests approval for directories outside the workspace in
restricted modes. Cursor and Grok use their own provider permission rules.

The server does not copy attachments into a project or bypass provider approval rules. If an agent
cannot read an attachment, the user must approve the access or select a runtime mode that permits it.

Updated attachment schemas tolerate unknown attachment members, but old image-only clients still
cannot decode messages that contain file attachments. Client file-picking rollouts must account for
this limit.

Do not run an old image-only server against state that contains file attachments. Replay decodes
each persisted event before projection. A file-bearing event can make `ProjectionPipeline` bootstrap
and `OrchestrationEngine` startup fail for the entire environment, not only the affected thread.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.
